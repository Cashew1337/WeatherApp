## Weather App

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple way to check the current weather and a 5-day upcoming forecast for a specific city they choose.

# Use

To use the application, navigate to the following URL:

https://cashew1337.github.io/WeatherApp/


From there, enter the city you want to check the weather in and hit search.
The weather data will then populate on the page.


Below is a screenshot of what the site will look like:
